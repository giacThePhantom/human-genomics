\textbf{\textit{Written by Maurizio Gilioli}}

\section{Main characteristics}
The human genome nowadays is being explored extensively thanks to exons and
whole-genome sequencing, epigenetic surveys, expression profiling of coding and
noncoding RNAs, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number profiling,
and functional assays. Those findings are essential to pave the way for the
future \textbf{precision medicine}, which is an approach for desease treatment
and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, living
environment, and lifestyle for each person. The scope is to administer the right
drug, at the right time and at the right dose for each individual. 

Below, some of the main utilizations of IGV, also represented in figure
\ref*{IGVusages}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{NGS alignment}
  \item \textbf{Epigenomics studies}
  \item \textbf{Copy number evaluations}
  \item \textbf{RNA-sequencings}
  \item \textbf{Identification of variants and genotypes}
\end{itemize}

The IGV software is an \textbf{high-performance lightweight visualization tool}
for interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic datasets. It supports a
\underline{wide variety of data types}, including next-generation sequence data,
and genomic annotations. Data sets can be loaded from local or remote sources,
including cloud-based resources.\\

It allows to move, zoom in and out quickly over different genomic scales
(subfigure \ref*{subfig: IGVnavigation}), and also to jump in precise positions
of the sequence. It is possible to search for genomic coordinates or gene names.
For each resolution scale (“zoom level”), the aggregated data is divided into
tiles (subfigure \ref*{subfig: TileV}) that correspond to a region viewable on a
typical user display. Each tile is subdivided into bins, with the width of a bin
chosen to correspond to the width represented by a pixel at that resolution
scale. The corresponding data tiles for each zoom level are stored in the binary
Tiled Data Format, or TDF, which has been optimized for fast tile retrieval.\\ 
\textit{A tiled data file (\textbf{TDF}) file} (.tdf) is a binary file that
contains data that has been preprocessed for faster display in IGV. TDF files
are generated by using the \textit{igvtools} package (\textit{toTDF} command).\\


\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{IGVview.PNG}
        \caption{IGV interface main features}
        \label{subfig: IGVnavigation}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{TileView.PNG}
        \caption{Tiles view in IGV}
        \label{subfig: TileV}
 
\end{figure}

Importantly, \textbf{tile} sizes for each zoom level are constant and small, and
also, a single tile at the lowest resolution (spanning the entire genome) has
the same memory footprint as a tile at the very high zoom levels (might span
only a few kilobases). \\
Tiles no longer in view are discarded as needed to free memory. Navigation
through a data set is similar to that of \textit{Google Maps}, allowing the user
to zoom and pan seamlessly across the genome at any level of detail from whole
genome to base pair.\\

\textbf{Pixel resolution errors}, occuring when data density exceeds the
constraint given by the number of pixels available for display, could be solved
through data aggregation. As the user zooms below the ~50 kb range, individual
aligned reads become visible. It is possible then to zoom further, and see the
bases at each position.\\
 
Annotations for specific genomes could be found consulting the UCSC Table

\subsection{Igvtools}
\textit{Igvtools} comprises a set of utilities to prepeare large files for efficient
display.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \caption{igvtools possible operations, the "count" function allows to generate coverage data, and it takes in input a BAM file. The obtained 
    file could be then loaded with the "Load pre-computed coverage data" commandq}

\subsection{Session Files}
Sessions are an integral part of IGV, allowing users to share their data and
views with other users simply and accurately. Session files describe the session
in \textbf{XML}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\section{Some of the main utilizations}
\textit{(I will not write down all the passages needed to obtain the figures
represented below, as they are included in the exercise file delivered by the
professor)}

\subsection{RNA-seq alignments}

    represented here on the curved lines. The peaks represent coverage within
    exons.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Study of variants}
It is possible to study variants from different samples.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{variantsView.PNG}
\end{figure}

It is also possible to sort the samples in different ways and to group them
considering different characteristics.



\section{Exercise}

The goal was to read pairs/end order/coverage/insert sizes at following
coordinates (hg19). Interpret, if possible, as inversion, inverted duplication,
tandem duplication, or deletion.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Task B}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \caption{\textit{\textbf{chr1:11,050,009-11,055,137}}: It could be a tandem
    duplication on one of the two alleles and a deletion on the other allele.
    The reason why I would suggest the presence of a deletion is due to the fact
    that the coverage remains quite constant, despite of the duplication.}

    both the alleles were deleted in that region, because of the decrease in
    coverage}

%expand this part with some information. Let me know.
